# Vision Library ðŸ‘€

A library that leverages advanced computer vision techniques to accurately detect and interpret human gestures in real-time, addressing one of the
key challenges in human-robot interaction from the perspective of intelligent robot assistants - creating a seamless communication interface between humans and robot assistants. While developed for my final year dissertation tailored to Pepper a social robot, this library can be flexibly used in mainstream computer vision systems. 

The gesture recognition system can learn new personalised gestures on the fly, mapping them to custom responses generated using local large language models. This feature aims to improve user engagement and satisfaction while allowing Pepper to follow the context of the interaction.
